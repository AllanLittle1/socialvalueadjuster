Question: How do I adjust nominal values to real terms using the GDP deflator?
Answer: To adjust nominal values to real terms, use the GDP deflator. For short time horizons, use the most recent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). For long time horizons, use forecasts from the OBR Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR). Beyond the FSR's range, extrapolate using the growth rate in the final year of the OBR's projection.

Question: What is the Social Time Preference Rate (STPR) used for?
Answer: The STPR is used to discount future values to present values in cost-benefit analysis, reflecting societyâ€™s preference for present consumption over future consumption. It has two components: time preference and the wealth effect.

Question: What are the steps to calculate present value using the Social Time Preference Rate as described in the Green Book?
Answer: The present value is calculated by discounting future values using the STPR. This involves multiplying future costs and benefits by discount factors corresponding to the appropriate time period. The standard discount rates are 3.5% for years 0-30, 3% for years 31-75, and 2.5% for years 76-125.

Question: When should I adjust the intervention cost in my scenario?
Answer: You should consider adjusting the intervention cost when there are significant changes in policy implementation costs, economic conditions, or when scaling the intervention to larger populations.
