## Example Interactions

Q: Why do we need to "Get Real" with our social value calculations?
A: "Getting Real" with social value calculations is crucial for several reasons:
1. Accurate comparison: It allows you to compare social benefits to investment costs in 'real terms', which is essential for calculating Social Return on Investment (SROI).
2. Credibility: Proper adjustments help maintain credibility with central and local government and other key funders.
3. Avoiding undervaluation: Recent high inflation rates mean you could be significantly undervaluing your social impacts. For example, values from five years ago could make your SROI about 20% higher than currently claimed.
Would you like me to explain more about how inflation affects social value calculations?

Q: Can you explain inflation in simple terms?
A: Certainly! Here's a simple explanation of inflation:
- Inflation refers to the rate at which prices for goods and services increase over time.
- When we talk about changes in 'real terms,' we're accounting for inflation to make better comparisons of the actual value of goods and services over time.
- The Treasury recommends using the 'GDP deflator' to adjust for inflation in social values. While you may have heard of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the GDP deflator is the preferred measure for this purpose.
Would you like to know more about how we use the GDP deflator in our calculations?

Q: How do I adjust for inflation in my social value calculations?
A: To adjust for inflation in social value calculations, follow these steps:
1. Use 'real' base year prices for costs and benefits in social value appraisal.
2. For short time horizons, use the GDP deflator from the latest Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts.
3. For longer horizons, refer to the OBR Fiscal Sustainability Report or extrapolate using the final year's growth rate.
4. Apply the formula: Real Value = Nominal Value × (GDP Deflator [Real Year] / GDP Deflator [Nominal Year])
5. For wellbeing adjustments, use the extended formula that accounts for changing marginal utility of income.
Would you like me to walk you through a specific calculation or explain the wellbeing adjustment in more detail?

Q: What's the difference between the regular inflation adjustment and the wellbeing adjustment?
A: The main difference between the regular inflation adjustment and the wellbeing adjustment is:
1. Regular inflation adjustment: This only accounts for changes in the general price level over time.
   Formula: Real Value = Nominal Value × (GDP Deflator [Real Year] / GDP Deflator [Nominal Year])

2. Wellbeing adjustment: This accounts for both inflation and the changing marginal utility of income as society's wealth increases.
   Formula: Real Value (Wellbeing) = Nominal Value × (GDP Deflator [Real Year] / GDP Deflator [Nominal Year]) × (GDP per Capita [Real Year] / GDP per Capita [Nominal Year])^1.3

The wellbeing adjustment includes an additional factor (GDP per Capita ratio) raised to the power of 1.3. This reflects that as society becomes wealthier, each additional pound of income contributes less to overall wellbeing.

Would you like me to explain why we use the power of 1.3 specifically, or how this affects your calculations in practice?

Q: Where can I find the latest GDP deflator data?
A: The Get Real App uses the most up-to-date GDP deflator data available. As of the last update:
- GDP Deflators: Market prices and money GDP.
- Outturn data are from the Quarterly National Accounts from ONS, last updated on 28 March 2024.
- Forecast data are consistent with OBR EFO data as at Budget 6 March 2024.
- For WELLBY estimation, we use GVA per head data: Gross domestic product (Average) per head at market prices, released on 10 May 2024.

Q: What is the value of a WELLBY?
A: The value of a WELLBY is £13,000 in 2019 prices, according to the HM Treasury Wellbeign Guidance for Appraisal. Use Get Real to update this value. 

Q: Why do we need to discount future values to present value?
A: Discounting future values to present value is crucial for several reasons:
1. Comparing projects: It enables a fair comparison of projects with different timelines and cash flows.
2. Comparing costs with benefits: For example, to compare the social value of upfront costs and downstream benefits.
3. Credibility: Government and other funders will expect your Social Return on Investment (SROI) to be in present values.
Discounting helps account for society's time preferences, as people generally prefer benefits now rather than later. Would you like me to explain more about how discounting affects SROI calculations?

Q: How is discounting different from inflation adjustment?
A: Discounting and inflation adjustment are two separate concepts:
1. Inflation adjustment: This accounts for changes in the general price level over time, converting nominal values to real values.
2. Discounting: This converts future real values to present values, accounting for society's time preference and opportunity cost of capital.
The process typically involves first adjusting for inflation to get real values, then discounting these real values to present values. Would you like me to walk you through an example of this two-step process?

Q: What discount rates should I use for my social value calculations?
A: The discount rates to use depend on the type of project and the time horizon:
1. Standard rate: 3.5% for years 0-30, 3% for years 31-75, and 2.5% for years 76-125.
2. Health rate: 1.5% for years 0-30, 1.29% for years 31-75, and 1.07% for years 76-125.
3. Reduced rates are available when the pure time preference rate is assumed to be 0%.
It's important to always refer to the latest Green Book guidance for the most up-to-date rates. The Get Real App uses rates based on the latest HM Treasury Green Book guidance (2023 update). Would you like me to explain why different rates are used for different time periods?

Q: How do I calculate the present value of future benefits or costs?
A: To calculate the present value of future benefits or costs:
1. Ensure all future values are in real terms (adjusted for inflation).
2. Apply the appropriate discount rate based on the project type and time horizon.
3. Use the formula: Present Value = Future Value / (1 + r)^t
   Where r is the discount rate and t is the number of years.
4. For streams of benefits or costs, calculate the present value for each year and sum them.
The Get Real App can perform these calculations for you. Would you like me to guide you through using the app for a specific calculation?

Q: Why does the discount rate reduce over time in the calculations?
A: The discount rate reduces over time to reflect:
1. Increasing uncertainty about the future: As we look further into the future, our ability to predict diminishes.
2. Intergenerational equity: A lower discount rate for the far future helps to give more weight to impacts on future generations.
3. Long-term growth expectations: The assumption that long-term economic growth rates may slow over time.
This reduction is built into the Get Real App calculator. For standard projects, the rate drops from 3.5% (years 0-30) to 3% (years 31-75) to 2.5% (years 76-125). Would you like more details on how this affects long-term project evaluations?

The app is regularly updated to ensure you're working with the most recent data. Would you like to know how to interpret these figures in your calculations?
