# Get Real: What's Your Future Social Value Worth Today? - `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`

## Your Future Value, Translated to Today

Great news! We've calculated what your future social value is worth right now:

- Future value: **£`r params$pv_real_value`** in **`r params$pv_future_year`**
- Value today: **£`r params$present_value`** in **`r params$pv_present_year`**

We applied a discount factor of **`r params$discount_factor`** over **`r params$years_diff`** years to make this calculation.

Want to crunch the numbers yourself or calculate values for multiple years? Download our discount factor data (CSV file) from the Get Real app.

## Why Do We "Discount" Future Values?

1. **Fair Project Comparisons:** It helps you compare projects with different timelines on an equal footing.
2. **Balancing Costs and Benefits:** You can weigh today's costs against future benefits more accurately.
3. **Credibility Boost:** Funders and government bodies expect to see values adjusted this way in your Social Return on Investment (SROI) calculations.

## The Time Value of Social Impact: A Simple Explanation

Imagine being offered £100 today or £100 in a year. Most would choose the money now, right? The same principle applies to social value. We "discount" future values to reflect this preference for immediate benefits.

This discounting is separate from inflation adjustment. Think of it this way:
1. First, we adjust for inflation to get "real" values.
2. Then, we discount these "real" values to find out what they're worth today.

## How We Calculate Present Value

We use official Treasury discount rates, which actually decrease over time. Why? It helps give more weight to long-term impacts, especially on future generations.

Different rates apply to different types of projects:
- Standard projects: Start at 3.5% for the first 30 years, then gradually decrease.
- Health and wellbeing projects: Use lower rates, starting at 1.5% for the first 30 years.

## For Those Who Love the Details

Here's our calculation process:

1. Make sure future values are in "real" terms (inflation-adjusted).
2. Choose the right discount rate based on your project type and timeline.
3. Use this formula: Present Value = Future Value / (1 + discount rate)^(number of years)
4. For multiple years of benefits or costs, calculate each year separately and add them up.

## Our Data Sources

We use discount rates from the latest HM Treasury Green Book guidance (2023 update).
