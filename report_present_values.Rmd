# Get Real: Present Values Report - `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`

## Your Present Value Calculation

Your future social value of **£`r params$pv_real_value`** in **`r params$pv_future_year`** has a present value of **£`r  params$present_value`** in **`r params$pv_present_year`**.
The discount factor applied was **`r params$discount_factor`** over a period of **`r params$years_diff`** years.

To validate these estimates, or to calculate present values over multiple years, you can download a CSV file with the discount factor series from the Get Real app.

## Why Discount to Present Values?

Discounting future values to present value is crucial for:

Comparing projects: Enabling a fair comparison of projects with different timelines and cash flows.
Comparing costs with benefits: For example, to compare the social value of upfront costs and downstream benefits.
Credibility: Government and other funders will expect your Social Return on Investment to be in present values.

## Non-technical Explainer

People generally prefer benefits now rather than later.
If your social costs and benefits occur in the future, you'll need to account for society's time preferences to estimate your Social Return on Investment (SROI).

Discounting helps us determine the 'present value' of social impacts when they're given in monetary terms.
Discounting is a completely separate concept to inflation.

Apply Treasury discount rates to your 'real' social value (after first removing inflation effects) to estimate the 'present value' of future social costs and benefits.

Note that the discount rate reduces over time - that's built into our calculator.
There are also different rates applied for standard vs health/wellbeing values, and based on time preferences.
You might need advice from trained social value practitioners to apply these.

## Technical Guidance Discounting Procedure:

First, ensure all future values are in real terms (adjusted for inflation).

Apply the appropriate discount rate based on the project type (standard or health) and time horizon.
Use the formula: Present Value = Future Value / (1 + r)\^t where r is the discount rate and t is the number of years.
For streams of benefits or costs, calculate the present value for each year and sum them.

Discount Rates:

-   Standard rate: 3.5% for years 0-30, 3% for years 31-75, and 2.5% for years 76-125.

-   Health rate: 1.5% for years 0-30, 1.29% for years 31-75, and 1.07% for years 76-125.

-   Reduced rates are available when the pure time preference rate is assumed to be 0%.

Discount Rates: Based on the latest HM Treasury Green Book guidance (2023 update).
