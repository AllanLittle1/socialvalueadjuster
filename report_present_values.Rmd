## Summary

Your future social value has been discounted from **£`r params$pv_real_value`** in **`r params$pv_future_year`** to a present value of **£`r params$present_value`** in **`r params$pv_present_year`**.

### Details

- Discount factor applied: `r params$discount_factor`
- Years discounted: `r params$years_diff`
- Discount rate type: `r if(params$pv_discount_type == "standard") "Standard" else "Health"`
- Rate variant: `r if(params$pv_rate_type == "standard_stpr") "Standard STPR" else "Reduced Rate"`

## Understanding Present Values

### Why discount future values?

Society generally prefers to receive benefits sooner rather than later. This preference is captured through discounting. Converting future values to present values is essential for:

1. **Fair comparison** - Compare projects with different timelines on an equal basis
2. **Balanced decision making** - Weigh upfront costs against future net benefits
3. **Credibility** - Meet Treasury Business Cases requirements

### How We Calculate Present Value

For individual future values, we use this formula:

Present Value = Future Value ÷ (1 + discount rate)^years

The discount rate varies by:
- Time period (lower rates for longer periods)
- Benefit type (lower rates for health/wellbeing)
- Pure time preference assumptions

## Technical Details

### Standard Discount Rates

- Years 0-30: 3.5%
- Years 31-75: 3.0%
- Years 76-125: 2.5%

### Health Discount Rates

- Years 0-30: 1.5%
- Years 31-75: 1.29%
- Years 76-125: 1.07%

### Tips

1. Always use real values (inflation-adjusted) before discounting
2. Never discount past values - only future ones
