Adjustments for inflation

5.11 Costs and benefits in appraisal of social value should be estimated in ‘real’ base year prices
(i.e. the first year of the proposal). This means the effects of general inflation should be removed.
The effects of converting values from nominal to real terms are shown in Table 1 using a GDP
deflator of 2%.

5.12 The following should be used to adjust prices from nominal to real terms:
- for short time horizons, whole economy inflation (the “GDP deflator”) from the most
recent forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)
- for long time horizons, forecasts of the GDP deflator published in the OBR Fiscal
Sustainability Report (FSR)
- for longer time horizons, beyond the end of the OBR’s FSR, the GDP deflator should be
extrapolated using the growth rate in the final year of the OBR’s projection

Table 1. Adjusting for the Effects of Inflation (Using a 2% GDP Deflator)
Year 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
Nominal terms £1,000 | £1,000 | £1,000 | £1,000 | £1,000 | £1,000
Real terms (year 0 prices) £1,000 | £980 | £961 | £942 | £924 | £906

5.13 For some goods or services there may be a relative price effect i.e. the movement of a specific
price index (e.g. construction) may differ significantly from the general inflation (such as the GDP
deflator). Where there is historical evidence and an expectation this will continue in the future,
different rates of inflation can be used to reflect the relative difference. For example, Information
Technology has become relatively less expensive over time and land used for development relatively
more expensive. Where prices or values are expected to grow in real terms, these assumptions
must be based on objective evidence, for example, long term trends in relevant indices. These
assumptions should be transparently set out in the business case and assumptions agreed with
the approving authority.

Discounting and Social Time Preference

5.32 Discounting is a technique used to compare costs and benefits occurring over different periods of time on a consistent basis. Discounting should be applied to all future costs and benefits. Discounting in appraisal of social value is based on the concept of time preference – that generally people prefer to receive goods and services now rather than later.

5.33 For individuals, time preference can be measured by the real interest rate on money lent or borrowed. Amongst other investments, people invest at fixed, low risk rates, hoping to receive more in the future to compensate for the deferral of consumption now. These real rates of return give some indication of their individual pure time preference rate. Society as a whole, also prefers to receive goods and services sooner rather than later. This is known as ‘social time preference’. The discount rate used in the Green Book is known as the ‘social time preference rate’ (STPR). It is the rate at which society values the present compared to the future.

5.34 The STPR has two components:
- ‘time preference’ – the rate at which consumption and public spending are discounted over time, assuming no change in per capita consumption. This captures the preference for value now rather than later.
- ‘wealth effect’ – this reflects expected growth in per capita consumption over time, where future consumption will be higher relative to current consumption and is expected to have a lower utility.

5.35 The STPR used in the Green Book is set at 3.5% in real terms, with exception for risk to life values which use a lower rate of 1.5%. The derivation of the discount rate can be found in Annex 6. Table 2 shows the present value of £1,000 declines in future years with a discount rate of 3.5%.

Table 2. Present Values and Discount Rate
Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
Value | £1,000 | £966 | £934 | £902 | £871 | £842 | £814 | £786 | £759 | £734 | £709

5.36 The main role of discounting is to put interventions with different time spans and benefit cost profiles on to a common “present value” basis. In the longer term (over 30 years), the STPR declines in a series of steps to allow for future uncertainty in the value of its constituent parts, as explained in Annex 6. The approach to discounting where there are inter-generational wealth transfers is also described in Annex 6. The accompanying tables in Annex 6 and associated tables on the Green Book web pages show both the discount rate and discount factors that can be used to calculate a present value.

5.37 Discounting is solely concerned with adjusting for social time preference and is separate from adjusting for inflation. The recommended Green Book discount rate applies to real values, with the effects of general inflation already removed. To promote transparency the best practice approach is to first convert costs or benefits to a real price basis, and then perform the discounting adjustment. The inflation rate and discount rate should not be added and applied to costs and benefits.

5.38 In appraisal, discounting should never be applied retrospectively to costs and benefits that have already occurred. Values do not increase simply because activities took place in the past (although of course the value of some assets may tend to increase over time). Discounting and the calculation of NPSV are illustrated further in Box 15.

5.39 Costs to government of raising funds (either through taxation or borrowing) are not a decision variable because the planned level of public spending is decided in advance when the budget is decided. It is at this macroeconomic stage that borrowing costs are considered. The decisions that are the concern of the Green Book are about the allocation of the given funds to meet government objectives in a way that optimizes social (public) value for money. The STPR is therefore not linked to the costs of raising funds (either through taxes or borrowing).

Box 15. NPSV and Discounting Worked Example
Alternative options, A and B, are both expected to improve the quality of a department’s work and reduce staff costs.
Option A requires £10 million in initial capital expenditure to realize benefits of £2.5 million per annum for the following four years (£2 million in reduced staff costs and £0.5 million in quality improvements).
Option B requires £5 million in initial capital expenditure to realize benefits of £1.5 million per annum for the following four years (£1 million reduced staff costs and £0.5 million in quality improvements).

Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
Option A (£m) | Costs | -10.00 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
Option A (£m) | Benefits | 0 | 2.50 | 2.50 | 2.50 | 2.50

A6.Discounting

A6.1 This Annex sets out the role of discounting in appraisal and how the 3.5% discount rate is
derived. It also provides guidance on long term discounting and the treatment of intergenerational
wealth transfers. Discounting and its role in appraisal are introduced in Chapter 2 paragraphs
2.22 ‑ 2.23 and Chapter 5 Paragraphs 5.32 ‑ 5.38 and Box 15.

Role of discounting

A6.2 Discounting in the public sector allows costs and benefits with different time spans to
be compared on a common “present value” basis. The public sector discount rate adjusts for
social time preference, defined as the value society attaches to present, as opposed to future,
consumption. It is based on comparisons of utility across different points in time or different
generations.

A6.3 The Green Book discount rate, known as the Social Time Preference Rate (STPR), for use in
UK government appraisal is set at 3.5% in real terms. This rate has been used in the UK since 2003.
Exceptions to the use of the standard STPR are outlined below.

A6.4 The use of the STPR in public sector appraisal differs from private sector discounting.
Decisions about the overall size of public spending and allocation of budgets are taken on a
top down basis. The costs associated with raising funds (i.e. through taxes or debt issuance) are
not used when appraising individual projects, programmes or policies. The cost of borrowing is
not included as a decision variable on whether to go ahead with an individual project or not. In
addition, there is no allowance for project specific risk in the STPR as risks should be identified and
costed explicitly in appraisal. This approach to the STPR contrasts with private sector discounting
which incorporates allowances for the cost of raising capital and compensation for risk.

Breakdown of the discount rate

A6.5 The STPR has two components:39
¨ ‘time preference’ – the rate at which consumption and public spending are discounted
over time, assuming no change in per capita consumption. This captures the preference
for value now rather than later.
¨ ‘wealth effect’ – this reflects expected growth in per capita consumption over time,
where future consumption will be higher relative to current consumption and is expected
to have a lower utility.
A6.6 The STPR is expressed as:
¨ r = ρ + μg
where:
¨ r is the STPR
¨ ρ (rho) is time preference comprising pure time preference (δ, delta) and catastrophic
risk (L)
¨ μg is the wealth effect. The marginal utility of consumption (μ, mu), multiplied by
expected growth rate of future real per capita consumption g
A6.7 As recognised in the 2003 Green Book there are a range of estimates of the individual
components of the discount rate.40 Research continues to illustrate a range of plausible estimates
but concludes that the overall discount rate of 3.5% remains within that range and is justifiable.41
A6.8 The way in which the STPR is applied in the Green Book requires each component to be
specified. This facilitates sensitivity analysis and clarifies treatment where individual components
of the discount rate should be adjusted (e.g. for health discounting). The overall values ascribed
to specific components of the STPR are retained from the 2003 edition as set out below. The
calculation of the STPR is shown in Box 37.
Estimates of ρ
A6.9 The estimate of ρ (rho) is the sum of:
¨ an allowance for time preference (δ)
¨ an allowance for unpredictable risks not normally included in appraisal, known as
‘catastrophic’ and ‘systemic’ risk (L)
A6.10 The risks contained in L could, for example, be disruptions due to unforeseeable and rapid
technological advances that lead to obsolescence, or natural disasters that are not directly connected
to the appraisal. L also includes a small premium for ‘systemic risk’ because costs and benefits are
usually positively correlated to real income per capita. With regard to time preference, δ, Freeman,
Groom and Spackman (2018)42 survey the evidence and show that plausible values range from 0%
to 1%. Coupled with an estimate of 1% for the risk component, L, this is compatible with a value
of 1.5% for the overall value of ρ.
A6.11 For the purposes of the STPR the estimate of δ is retained at 0.5% and the
estimate of L is retained at 1%. The estimate of ρ is therefore 1.5%.
Estimates of μ and g
A6.12 Available evidence suggests a range of plausible values of μ (mu). The 2003 edition of the
Green Book set a value of 1. As set out in Annex 3, the estimate used by DWP for distributional
weighting is 1.3 (based on Layard et al. 200843), while Groom and Maddison (2018)44 use a
number of techniques to estimate a pooled value of 1.5.
A6.13 Historic growth rates in consumption per capita depend on the time period considered
and the extent to which more recent growth rates or projections are considered to be
representative of long term trends. The 2003 Green Book set g at 2%. Freeman, Groom and

Annex A6: Discounting

A6.14 Future projected growth rates are also relevant. Long-run forecasts of GDP growth (rather
than consumption) from the Office of Budget Responsibility are for growth of 2.2% per year in
real terms. This implies an annual projected growth rate of GDP per capita of 1.9%.47
A6.15 Taken together, the range of estimates of μ and g suggest 2% remains plausible
as an estimate of the overall wealth effect. For the purposes of the STPR the estimate
of μ is retained at 1 and g at 2%.

Box 37. Calculation Of STPR
r = ρ + μg
Where ρ = 1.5%; μ = 1.0; and g = 2%
0.015 + 1*0.02 = 3.5%

Exceptions to the standard STPR

A6.16 The recommended discount rate for risk to health and life values is 1.5%. This is because the
‘wealth effect’, or real per capita consumption growth element of the discount rate, is excluded.
As set out in Annex 2, health and life effects are expressed using welfare or utility values, such
as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), as opposed to monetary values. The diminishing marginal
utility associated with higher incomes does not apply as the welfare or utility associated with
additional years of life will not decline as real incomes rise.
A6.17 The standard UK discount rate may not be appropriate for appraisal of Official Development
Assistance (ODA) expenditure. For example, long term growth rates, the probability of catastrophic
risk and the macro-economic effects associated with expenditure may differ. An appropriate
estimate of the STPR for the recipient country should be used. Government departments should
contact Department for International Development if they require further information.
Long term discounting
A6.18 Policies or projects which involve long term effects may require a different approach.
This can be particularly important for policies expected to have significant environmental effects.
Where long term effects are expected to occur, the appraisal of proposals may involve longer
timescales. Generally, the maximum life span of an intervention is assumed to be up to 60 years.
This may be extended where there is evidence a longer time period is required for the full effects
of an intervention to materialise.
A6.19 The standard STPR of 3.5% applied in appraisal should decline over the long term due to
uncertainty about future values of its components. To support practical application in appraisal,
standard declining discount rates and discount factors by year can be found in Table 7 and the
corresponding values for the reduced health rate are given in Table 8.
45 See Freeman, Groom and Spackman (2018) “Social Discount Rates for Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Report for HM Treasury” published on the HMT Green
Book web page.
46 The ONS quarterly national accounts publication provides historic consumption data. Based on analysis in December 2017 the approximate compound
annual growth rate in consumptions per capita between 1996 and 2016 was 1.7%. Freeman, Groom and Spackman (2018) provide a range of estimates
for different historical horizons.

outlook – supplementary documents published on 24th of January 2018. Estimate of average long-term GDP per capita growth consistent with OBR’s
long term economic determinants.

Intergenerational effects
A6.20 Where the possible effects of an intervention being examined as part of an appraisal are
long term and involve very substantial or irreversible wealth transfers between generations further
sensitivity analysis is appropriate. This could include irreversible changes to the natural
environment. This involves applying both the standard Green Book discount rate and a reduced
discount rate (excluding pure social time preference, δ) to costs and benefits.
A6.21 When applying this approach the Net Present Social Value (NPSV) using the standard
STPR and the reduced rate STPR should both be included in the results of the appraisal and
explained clearly. The difference between these two estimates of NPSV provides an estimate of the
intergenerational wealth transfer attributable to pure social time preference which should be part
of the explanation of the approach. The basis for the approach to long-term discounting set out
here can be found in supplementary guidance on intergenerational wealth transfers and social
discounting.

A6.22 In addition to declining values for the standard STPR and a reduced rate STPR further
sensitivity analysis to increase transparency and visibility of long term effects can be undertaken.
This involves presenting:
¨ the average discounted annual cost of the effect over the first 30 years, alongside the
calculation of UK welfare
¨ an indication of how long the effect is expected to persist
¨ an indication of the level of accuracy indicated by a range of reasonable values
¨ an explanation of how the value may be expected to change in the future
A6.23 Further information on the basis for this approach to intergenerational effects can be
found in supplementary guidance on intergenerational wealth transfers and social discounting.
Discounting and inflation
A6.24 Discounting is solely concerned with adjusting for social time preference and has nothing
to do with adjusting for inflation. The recommended Green Book discount rate applies to real
values, with the effects of general inflation already removed. To promote transparency the best
practice approach is to first convert costs or benefits to a real price basis, and then perform the
discounting adjustment. The inflation rate and discount rate should not be added and applied to
costs and benefits, as it gives an arithmetically incorrect result.

Approach 2: Calculating the willingness to pay for life satisfaction changes

The second approach is based on analysis of the relationship between ln(income) and life satisfaction. Fujiwara (2021) finds the coefficient on ln(income) is 1.25 (with life satisfaction measured on a 1-7 scale). We can define a WELLBY in this context as the aggregation of WTP for many infinitesimally small individual gains in life satisfaction which sum to 1 point of life satisfaction for one year (i.e. 1 WELLBY).104 If life satisfaction us related to ln(income), this can be computed as the inverse of the marginal utility of income: 𝑊𝑇𝑃−𝑊𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐵𝑌=[𝑓′(ln(𝑀))𝑀]−1=𝑀𝛽𝑌
This expression is simply the marginal rate of substitution between income and life satisfaction. In this expression 𝛽𝑌 is the coefficient on ln(income), converted to a 0-10 scale. Given we are using a ln(income) coefficient of 1.25 on a 1-7 scale, this needs multiplying by 11/7 to be expressed on a 0-10 scale. Then, we have: 𝛽𝑌=117(1.25)=1.96
We can then calculate the WTP per WELLBY with reference to average earnings based on ONS data, which were £30,673 in 2019 as follows: 𝑊𝑇𝑃 (𝑊𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐵𝑌)=£30,6731.96=£15,649.
For simplicity this is rounded to £16,000.
Deriving the central recommended WELLBY value
Summarising, we have derived two estimates of the monetary equivalent value of a WELLBY, £10,023, and £15,649 (both in 2019 prices and values). We treat these as the upper and lower bound, and take the mid-point as the recommended central estimate of the WTP-per-WELLBY, which is then: 𝑊𝑇𝑃 (𝑊𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐵𝑌)=10,000+16,0002=£13,000.
Therefore, the recommended value of a WELLBY, alongside the low-high range recommended for sensitivity testing, is given in the below table.

Further details: price year and discounting

To convert to convert this figure into a different price and value base year using outturn ONS economic data, the following formula should be used:
𝑊𝑇𝑃 (𝑊𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐵𝑌𝑡)=𝑊𝑇𝑃 (𝑊𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐵𝑌𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒)∙𝐺𝐷𝑃_𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑡𝐺𝐷𝑃_𝑑𝑒𝑓𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒∙(𝐺𝐷𝑃_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝐺𝐷𝑃_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒)1.3
Where 1.3 is the negative of the marginal utility of income elasticity, taken from the HMT Green Book Annex 3 on distributional weights (HMT, 2020). Applying the elasticity in this way ensures that the ‘utility value’ of one unit of life satisfaction change is held constant over time.
In appraisal, changes in wellbeing which occur in future years are discounted using the Green Book ‘health’ discount rate which starts at 1.5% (years 0-30) and declines gradually thereafter. This is because the ‘wealth effect’, or real per capita consumption growth element of the discount rate, is excluded, again preserving constant a utility value per point change in life satisfaction in future years. Please refer to the HMT Green Book, Annex A6. Note, the WELLBY value should always be uprated to the appraisal base year using the formula above.
